00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.648
I hardly wear makeup, but I've seen on the internet that people can make their mouths ...

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:10.056
Bigger, I don't know ...

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:12.670
These are the corners of the lips.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.317
I heard that if you put a few lines here, it

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:23.951
makes the corners of your lips and mouth appear longer, longer ... Let's see.

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.517
I think I overdid it.

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:30.517
I overdid it.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.680
Do you notice any difference?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.401
I'm going to give this session ... I'm going to consider it failed, okay?

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.767
I don't know ... I'm not ... I wasn't born for makeup.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.470
Oh God.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.775
Let's prepare the food.

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:50.613
Damn this light.

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:57.882
I have prepared ingredients here because I am going to make a wonderful sandwich.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:06.838
For this I have prepared lettuce, butter, tuna, a frying pan because I don't have a toaster ...

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:13.404
And with these ingredients and others such as sandwich bread.

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.466
Bread. I can only buy this bread,

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.889
OMG, wait-

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:26.423
I can only buy this bread, because baguette bread in Korea is more expensive ...

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:28.102
It is expensive as hell.

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:34.521
It's like two euros something a super small loaf of bread?

00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:35.530
It's crazy.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.364
Ok we also need mayonnaise and onion

00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:42.000
and we are going to prepare this.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The first thing you want to do is take your butter knife

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.309
and spread the butter on the slice of bread.

00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:03.839
Normally I would spread the butter on both sides of the bread, on both sides,

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:12.351
but we don't have the funds, okay? Because butter is also very expensive here in Korea,

00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:15.942
well, everything is more expensive, I mean ...

00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:21.195
The next thing you want to do is light your fire,

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:31.248
or your induction, or whatever you have and put the pan and toast the bread on both sides as if it were toast.

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:38.261
I do this step in the pan because I don't have a toaster.

00:02:38.261 --> 00:02:45.748
While the bread is toasting (I've had to look in the dictionary if it was toasted, or toasted, it was toasted).

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:50.253
While the bread is toasting, we are going to open the can of tuna,

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:57.151
we are going to drain all the oil and we are going to put the tuna in a bowl.

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:01.834
Appreciate my tuna ASMR. Speed x2

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:11.370
Next you need an onion, or rather a piece of onion,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.903
because a whole onion is too much onion.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:20.932
And you are going to cut it small, I did not cut it super, super small

00:03:20.985 --> 00:03:28.867
because this size seemed fine to me, but if you like extra small onion you cut it more

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:34.912
and if you too lazy, then you cut it bigger and that's it.

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:41.319
We add that onion in the bowl with the tuna and add mayonnaise.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.488
We mix again, we stir it, we mix it all.

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:58.862
I am mixing with a chopstick because I am in Asia. If you are in Europe or America or any other continent other than Asia,

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:05.022
you can mix with a fork, or with a spoon, or with your hand, or whatever you want.

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:11.645
But in the meantime make sure you keep an eye on the pan, so that your toast doesn't burn,

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:13.840
like mine.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.362
Take a selfie with your bowl with tuna, mayonnaise and onion to demonstrate that you know how to cook,

00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:28.126
and then give it a try to see if what you have cooked is vomiting or decent.

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:35.116
Once you have made sure that the mixture is decent, you take the toast out of the pan,

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:41.548
and add a drizzle of oil to remove the dryness a bit, because nobody

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:45.434
likes to eat a sandwich that tastes like cardboard.

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:51.269
You add the mixture of tuna, onion and mayonnaise and at the same time you

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:58.570
take and in the same pan that you have used to toast ...

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.880
that you have used for your toast, and fry an egg.

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.405
My intention was to fry an egg, but it broke so we are going to turn it

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:15.840
into a scrambled egg.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.751
You pile it up there  as best you can,

00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.000
a little lettuce.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.706
You put the other toast, the other slice of bread as a cover,

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:36.827
and you cut it in half and that would be it, there you have your wonderful sandwich.

00:05:41.054 --> 00:05:51.083
The result should be something like this here, but with an egg. With egg it is better.

00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:08.713
It was a good invention, I recommend that you try it if you like the ingredients it contains.
